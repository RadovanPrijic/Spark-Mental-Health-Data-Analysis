govore nam da u njoj definitivno ima zrno istine. \\\nVidimo da nema znaƒçajnih razlika u zastupljenosti depresije, ≈°to sam i predvideo, jer je depresija mentalna bolest koja je primarno uzrokovana subjektovim oseƒáanjem nevoljenosti, odnosno izuzetno nezadovoljenom potrebom za ljubavlju. \\\nPo drugoj strani, kod anksioznosti imamo popriliƒçno signifikantnu razliku izmedju studenata in≈æenjerskih smerova i generalne studentske populacije - 7%. Ovo ima smisla, jer studij na in≈æenjerskim smerovima generalno podrazumeva naporan tempo rada i natproseƒçan nivo odricanja (poznato je da ovi smerovi imaju dosta visok \"dropout rate\"), ≈°to odmah poveƒáava moguƒánost neadekvatnog zadovoljenja dominantnih psiholo≈°kih potreba u osobi, odnosno oseƒáanja ugro≈æenosti na egzistencijalnom nivou - a to je plodno tle za nastanak anksioznosti. Anksioznost je, usput budi reƒçeno, u pozadini veƒáine bla≈æih do srednje intenzivnih depresivnih epizoda, ≈°to je, bar u mojim oƒçima, generalno pravi opasnijom \"zverkom\". \\\nJedino ≈°to me jeste u manjoj meri iznenadilo je ƒçinjenica da nema razlike u prisutnosti paniƒçnih napada kod jednih i drugih, ali to ƒáu pripisati generalnoj nepouzdanosti ovog uzorka. Treba priznati da je on popriliƒçno mali i geografski jednoliƒçan, a pored toga ima i apsurdno visoke postotke za prisutnost mentalnih bolesti kod studenata (potencijalnih razloga za≈°to je ovo tako ima vi≈°e, ali nam za potrebe ovog zakljuƒçka nisu bitni). \\\nSvakako je primarna lekcija testiranja ove hipoteze da nam, kao studentima informatike, mentalna higijena mora biti jo≈° toliko

Da li su ≈æenske zaista bolje u mentalnoj higijeni nego mu≈°karci? Po mom liƒçnom mi≈°ljenju, odgovor je jedno veliko *DA*. \\\nGornji rezultati na prvi pogled i govore, i ne govore u prid tome. Vidimo da je medju studentima veƒái postotak anksioznosti kod mu≈°kih, dok je kod depresije i paniƒçnog poremeƒáaja veƒái postotak na ≈æenskoj strani. U drugom skupu podataka, situacija je popriliƒçno izjedanƒçena, ali opet izgleda kao da su mu≈°karci malo \"u prednosti\", odnosno imaju manje problema. \\\nMislim da su navedeni rezultati popriliƒçno varljivi i neintuitivni, a ne poklapaju se ni sa mojim anegdotalnim iskustvom. Za prvi skup podataka sam veƒá rekao da je upitnog kvaliteta, ali svakako mislim da bi veƒái postotak mentalnih bolesti kod ≈æenskih u prva dva skupa mogao biti prosto rezultat toga da su one bolje u prepoznavanju istih. Iako je emocionalna pismenost u populaciji generalno na katastrofalnom nivou, ≈æenske su po mom iskustvu dosta bolje u priƒçanju o svojim mentalnim tegobama, a ƒçesto i bolje u prepoznavanju unutra≈°njeg nemira i reagovanju na njega. Mu≈°karci, po drugoj strani, su ovde u velikom zaostatku, jer ih na putu ka ozbiljnoj mentalnoj higijeni spreƒçavaju razne ≈°tetne kulturne vrednosti. Drugim reƒçima, bavljenje svojim emocijama, te priƒçanje o njima, se ne poklapa sa slikom \"pravog mu≈°karca\" (LOL). Na≈° \"smoking gun\" u svemu ovome su proseƒçne stope suicida, odnosno poslednja dva grafika, koje u velikoj meri potvrdjuju da je ova hipoteza razmi≈°ljanje u pravom smeru. \\\nStvar je, na kraju, relativno prosta. Adekvatna kontrola emocija je sveti gral mentalne higijene, a ≈æenske su u tom segmentu (barem zasad) *znaƒçajno* bolje od mu≈°karaca.
